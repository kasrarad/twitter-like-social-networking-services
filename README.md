# Project

Twitter is one of the world's most popular social media platform. Today, many businesses are using twitter to reach wider audience and expand their influence. This web application is a variation of a twitter like web application where users can have rapid communication with one another by sharing and liking posts. However, we want to put our own twist to the application by directing users to dedicate their posts about technology. Namely, interesting books or articles that might be useful to read as software developers or things that they learned through hacking X. We want this application to encourage open source concept of  sharing  and helping one another to learn and become better software developers.
